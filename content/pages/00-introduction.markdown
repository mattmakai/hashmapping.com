# Introduction
You're not a software developer yourself, but you still need to interact 
with, manage and market to developers. If you find yourself confused over 
the dizzying array of technical concepts such as IDEs, webhooks and

Hashmapping explains technical concepts in plain language so that anyone, 
technical or non-technical, can understand and then use them accurately in 
conversations.
